### Hi there

I'm a self learning french dev who like to do many sort of things on my spare time :
* Procedural stuff (by code or nodes) : vfx, 3d models, textures, etc...
* Write softwares for artist (NoodlesPlate, SdfFontDesigner, SdfMesher, wxShade)
* Write softwares for made the developper life easier  (ImGuiFontStudio, ImGuIFileDialog, cTools, MagicaVoxel_File_Writer)
* Or just for fun haha
